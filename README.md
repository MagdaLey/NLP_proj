###  main.py - web scrapper already used    -> in AccidentsData.csv we have its output

### accidents_page_news.html - html code for the webpage with news on accidents listed
### exact_news.html - code of a page of one of the news 

### accident_data_labeled.json is a file that contains 10 news with labeled "reason" and "sequence of actions" of the accident - this file is created to train the existing model (maybe BART) to recognize these elements in the news' text
